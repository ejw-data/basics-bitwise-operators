# Bitwise Operations (Python)

### Purpose
> Occasionally I am asked during the bootcamp to explain the difference between bitwise and logical operators when using pandas.  I created this repo to have handy so I can provide some examples more quickly.

### Content
*  `initial_example`:  Contains a simple function to show the bit representation of an integer.  Several examples are provided to illustrate Pythons use of logical operators and how these are affected by using pandas series.


### Status
*  This is a work-in-progress.
